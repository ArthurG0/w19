## Open Review Session

The Open Review Session will be **in TBD from TBD on Monday, Feb 25th.** 
Tutors will go over practice problems.
Feel free to stop by at any time during that interval to ask for help with any of the topics or practice problems.



Have fun practicing what you've learned so far!

Remember: **programming is not a spectator's sport** -- you have to actively write code in order to get better at writing, reading, and debugging it.
