## Goals for this lab

In preparation for the final exam, practice writing code for the following concepts:

* Flow control if-else statements
* Data types and declarations
* While loops
* For loops
* Evaluating expressions
* Data representation
* Arrays
* Passing parameters to functions
* Passing arrays to functions and returning arrays from functions
* Pointers
* Structs
* Pointers and structs
* Pointers and arrays
* Arrays of structs
* Dynamic Memory Allocation
* Linked-lists
* Strings
* Iteration through lists
* Recursion on linked lists and strings


## Log in and create a local directory

* Under your **cs16** directory, create a new directory named **lab09** (refer to lab00 for instructions if you have forgotten how to do this)

There is no starter code: you get to create it from scratch.


## Create a repo on github in our class organization

As usual, start by creating a repo _in the **ucsb-cs16-w19** organization_. 

Make sure that when you create a repo, the **Owner** is the **ucsb-cs16-w19** organization (**NOT** your personal account).



## Submit your code on Gradescope<a name="submit"></a>

Once you are satisfied that **your programs are correct**, then it's time to submit them. 

Log into your account on [https://www.gradescope.com/](https://www.gradescope.com/) and navigate to our course site. Select this assignment. Then click on the "Submit" button on the bottom right corner to make a submission. You will be given the option of  uploading files from your local machine or submitting the code that is in a Github repo. _Select the second option and select your Github repo for this assignment._ You should receive full credit for submitting at least some attempt on this lab.



## Log Out!<a name="done"></a>

You are now done with this assignment!
If you are in the Phelps lab or in CSIL, make sure to log out of the machine before you leave. Also, make sure to close all open programs before you log out. Some programs will not work next time if they are not closed. Remember to save all your open files before you close your text editor.

If you are logged in remotely, you can log out using the `exit` command:

`$ exit`


## Grading rubric

In addition to the points given by gradescope, our staff may be manually grading your code for style. Code style, includes but is not limited to the following:

1. Code can be easily understood by humans familiar with C++ (including both the author(s) of the code, and non-authors of the code.)
2. Code is neatly indented and formatted, following standard code indentation practices for C++ as illustrated in either the textbook, or example code given in lectures and labs
3. Variable names choices are reasonable
4. Code is reasonably "DRY" (as in "don't repeat yourself")&mdash;where appropriate, common code is factored out into functions
5. Code is not unnecessarily or unreasonably complex when a simpler solution is available
